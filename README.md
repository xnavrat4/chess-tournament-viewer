Copy the application binary to a folder (e.g., /opt/chessViewer/)

`cp UltraWide /opt/chessViewer/`

Create deskop file

### Windows
install Qt6 with QtCreator

install MS Visual Studio 19 Tools

The most straightforward is to build the project with QT6 kit in release mode directly in Qt Creator IDE. For the demostration Qt 6.3.2 will be used, but feel free to substitute the version.

Copy the compiled binary to an empty folder.

Create an environment by running the command in command prompt

`C:\Qt\6.3.2\msvc2019_64\bin\qtenv2.bat`
`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat`

use windeploy tool to deploy the application

`C:\Qt\6.3.2\msvc2019_64\bin\windeployqt.exe /path/to/UltraWide.exe`

Since building QT applications on Windows is quite a pain, the releases come with prebuild windows application
